I spearheaded a comprehensive data analytics project for a pizza shop using Power BI and SQL, aimed at extracting valuable insights to drive business growth. The project entailed meticulous tracking and analysis of key performance indicators, including total revenues, total orders, and best-selling items categorized by both order frequency and price.

In this endeavor, I employed advanced SQL queries to extract and manipulate the dataset, ensuring data integrity through rigorous cleaning processes. These queries were meticulously documented, accompanied by detailed screenshots showcasing the results.

To facilitate an in-depth analysis, I leveraged the powerful visualization capabilities of Power BI. This included the use of dynamic slicers and interactive dashboards, which allowed for seamless cross-verification of data insights. The visualizations provided a granular view of the sales performance, enabling stakeholders to filter and analyze data on a daily and monthly basis.

The culmination of this project not only provided actionable insights into sales trends and customer preferences but also laid the groundwork for informed decision-making and strategic planning.
